This study applies the Theory of Planned Behavior to explore attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control (PBC) in purchasing behavior. It suggests that attitudes and PBC are strong predictors of purchase intentions, while subjective norms based on peer recommendations have a moderate influence.
